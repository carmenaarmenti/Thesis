\subsection{Bug fixing task}
Each instance of the dataset is a pair $(m_b, m_f)$, where $m_b$ is a buggy code component and $m_f$ is the
corresponding fixed code. These BFPs were used to train the NMT model, allowing it to learn the translation
from the buggy to the fixed method, thus being able to generate fixing patches.
\subsection{Code summarization task}
