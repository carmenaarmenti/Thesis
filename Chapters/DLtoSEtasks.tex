\subsection{Bug fixing task}
Each instance of the dataset is a pair $(m_b, m_f)$, where $m_b$ is a buggy code component and $m_f$ is the
corresponding fixed code. These BFPs were used to train the NMT model, allowing it to learn the translation
from the buggy to the fixed method, thus being able to generate fixing patches.
\subsection{Code summarization task}Ã¹
Automatic source code summarization is the task of generating short natural language description 
for source code \cite{Leclair2020}. The idea is that a brief description allows programmers to understand
what a chunk of code does and what is the purpose of the program by and large, without necessarily read the code 
itself.\\
